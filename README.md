# AFTV1TB-LC
Well i have a AFTV modding tool. The main page is on XDA
The linux version will be compiled at a slower rate so expect a release at a different time
Heres the XDA link to the main version https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/aftv1-launcher-changer-toolbox-no-root.4603677/

This is a 2 step tool to get working at the start
